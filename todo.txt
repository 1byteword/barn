End-to-end workflow for adding, encrypting, and storing key-value (KV) pairs using a similar storage philosophy to Vault. We'll use the following technologies and algorithms:

Encryption Algorithm: XChaCha20-Poly1305
Key Derivation Function: HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function)
Master Key: Shamir's Secret Sharing
Serialization Format: JSON

Detailed workflow:

Adding a KV Pair:

[DONE] Receive a new KV pair (key and value) from the user or application.
[DONE] Validate and sanitize the input to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.
[DONE] Serialize the KV pair into a JSON object: {"key": "example_key", "value": "example_value"}.


Encryption:

Generate a random 256-bit data encryption key (DEK) using a secure random number generator.
Use HKDF with the DEK and a unique KV pair identifier (e.g., a counter or UUID) to derive a 256-bit encryption key (EK) and a 192-bit nonce (IV).

HKDF(DEK, KV_pair_identifier) -> (EK, IV)


Encrypt the serialized JSON object using XChaCha20-Poly1305 with the derived EK and IV.

XChaCha20-Poly1305(JSON_object, EK, IV) -> encrypted_data


Encode the encrypted data using base64 to obtain a string representation.


Next part is for production only, dev instances should simply login using a root token. Production grade access is only granted via key shares.


Master Key and DEK Encryption:

Generate a master key using Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm.

Split the master key into n shares, with a threshold of k shares required to reconstruct the key.
Distribute the shares securely among multiple Vault nodes or unseal keys.


Encrypt the DEK using the master key with an authenticated encryption algorithm like AES-256-GCM.

AES-256-GCM(DEK, master_key) -> encrypted_DEK


Encode the encrypted DEK using base64.


Storage:

Define a storage directory for encrypted secrets, e.g., /var/lib/barn/secrets/.
Create a subdirectory within the storage directory based on the first few characters of the KV pair's key. This helps distribute the files evenly and improves performance.

For example, if the key is "example_key", create a subdirectory like /var/lib/vault-competitor/secrets/ex/.


Generate a unique filename for the encrypted KV pair using a deterministic naming scheme, e.g., <key>_<timestamp>.
Write the base64-encoded encrypted data to the file in the corresponding subdirectory.


Metadata Storage:

Store the necessary metadata for each encrypted KV pair, including:

Key: The original key of the KV pair.
Encrypted DEK: The base64-encoded encrypted DEK.
KV Pair Identifier: The unique identifier used during encryption.
Timestamp: The timestamp indicating when the KV pair was added.


Create a separate metadata file or database to store the metadata, indexed by the KV pair's key.


Retrieving a KV Pair:

Receive a request to retrieve the value for a specific key.
Look up the metadata for the given key in the metadata file or database.
Retrieve the encrypted DEK and KV pair identifier from the metadata.
Reconstruct the master key using the required number of Shamir's Secret Sharing shares.
Decrypt the encrypted DEK using the reconstructed master key and the AES-256-GCM algorithm.
Locate the encrypted KV pair file in the storage directory based on the key and subdirectory structure.
Read the encrypted data from the file and decode it from base64.
Use HKDF with the decrypted DEK and the KV pair identifier to derive the EK and IV.
Decrypt the encrypted data using XChaCha20-Poly1305 with the derived EK and IV.
Deserialize the decrypted JSON object to obtain the original value.
Return the value to the requesting user or application.
